## SAMPLE WELCOME SPEECH FOR A CORPORATE EVENT
 

If you’ve ever attended a CORPORATE EVENT, then you know the welcome speech gets all of the attention. The welcome speech is what allures the attendees to either listen and take interest… or not want to participate at all. Given that, welcome speeches are really important and should be long enough to address everyone properly but short enough to not bore everyone in the room.
